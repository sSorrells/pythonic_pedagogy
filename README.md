# pythonic_pedagogy

This repository is the first store of my materials for online "self-teaching" of Python, including basic concepts of development along with those of data analysis and data science. My grasp of organizing files with Git/Github is rudimentary, but I will do my best to keep it structured according to the subject matter I am learning as I go along.

I have been working with beginner Python tutorials for a few months, predominantly through Udemy offerings from Jose Portilla of Pierian Data Inc. and Kirill Eremenko & Hadelin de Ponteves of SuperDataScience. My math background is lacking to pursue at depth some of the advanced concepts contained in some of these course and bootcamp offerings, but I have been augmenting with Udemy calculus tutorials from Krista King, as well as a UT's older (2014), Python-based LAFF linear algebra course taught by Robert van de Geijn, and Udacity's statistics course presented by Katie Kormanik. 

I'll expand upon the readme file as I begin to push code and other learning materials related to Pythonic data science and supporting subject matter.
